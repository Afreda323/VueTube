# vuetube

Decided to recreate my first React project in Vue as a way to understand more about Vue.js concepts

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
